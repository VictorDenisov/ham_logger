The name stands for hacker ham log. This is a ham logger for hams who are also
hackers. If you don't want to waste your time on dealing with graphical
interfaces this is the tool for you.

Right now the functionality is very limited. It addresses my personal
aspirations in ham radio logging. I log my pota and sota contacts using
Rite-in-the-Rain books. However when I come back home I need to type the
contacts into a computer. Jumping between lots of text fields that usually make
up interfaces of most of ham logging software is not fun and is not exactly the
fastest way to do it.

This logger allows you to type the fields that you have in a tab separated file.
Vim editor is very efficient in dealing with tab separated files. Then you
invoke the logger with the template that you want to serialize into an ADIF file
and you are good to upload your logs to POTA or LOTW.

There are plans to add command line interface to this logger for logging during
contests. Again no jumping between text fields is expected. Type in only the
values that you have separated by space or tab and the logger will do the rest.
